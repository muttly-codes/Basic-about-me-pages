    <p>Lee Young is a junior web developer who has come to this career via many roads not travelled very often. Most
        of these roads are relevant to the JWD role he now aspires to... (And there are some a little less so.)</p>

        <p>Below are some links to Lee's folios of work. Please feel free to explore his meagre accomplishments and to go ahead and spit on them is you find them to be offensive or even just less than worthy of your time.</p>
       <h4>Link Types</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Absolute Links, like the following to 
                <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
                target='_blank'>the Mozilla Developer Network</a>, the go to resource on the web, about the web, for developers of the web. </li>
            <li>Relative links work like this one to 
                <a href='links-and-images/misc/extras.html'>the extras page</a>.</li>
            <li>Root-Relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
                but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
        </ul>
